# Nsight Systems — Agent Knowledge Base

> **Purpose:** Machine-readable documentation for the nsys-agent. Each file covers one topic from the official NVIDIA documentation, saved as plain markdown for easy querying, embedding, and retrieval.

## ⚠️ Version Awareness

Nsight Systems evolves across releases. The SQLite export schema, CLI flags, and available trace types change between versions. Files in this knowledge base are annotated with the source version where applicable.

**Key version differences to watch for:**
- SQLite table names and columns may change between major versions
- New trace types are added (e.g., advanced NCCL tracing in 2025.6.1)
- CLI flags may be deprecated or renamed
- New `--pytorch` options added in recent versions

Always check `nsys --version` on the target system and cross-reference with the versioned docs at `https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/<VERSION>/`.

## How This Knowledge Base Is Used

1. **Agent context seeding** — Load relevant files as context when the agent starts a profiling task
2. **Query answering** — Search files for specific CLI flags, SQL queries, or API patterns
3. **Version tracking** — Compare against actual nsys version to detect capability differences
4. **Workflow templates** — Copy example commands and SQL queries directly into profiling scripts
