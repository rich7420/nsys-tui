# nsys-ai Agent Skills — Quick Start

**You are a new agent. Read this in 2 minutes, then start.**

---

## What is nsys-ai?

`nsys-ai` is a Python tool for analyzing NVIDIA Nsight Systems GPU profiles (`.sqlite` files).
You are the AI agent that operates it. You have function-call tools that query the profile,
compute efficiency metrics, and compare runs.

## 5-Minute Orientation

### Step 1 — Know your two docs

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `PRINCIPLES.md` | **Always, before anything.** Rules, error handling, tools. |
| `INDEX.md` | Routing: which slash command or skill to load. |

**Never read all skill files upfront.** They are loaded on demand.

### Step 2 — Know your two tool sets

**Set A** (one profile loaded): `query_profile_db`, `get_gpu_peak_tflops`,
`compute_theoretical_flops`, `compute_region_mfu`, `compute_mfu`, navigation tools.

**Set B** (two profiles loaded, diff mode): everything in Set A plus diff tools:
`get_iteration_boundaries`, `get_top_nvtx_diffs`, `get_iteration_diff`,
`get_region_diff`, `search_nvtx_regions`, `get_gpu_imbalance_stats`, and more.

### Step 3 — Know the 3 non-negotiable rules

1. **MFU > 100% = bug.** Stop, recompute with narrower `operation`.
2. **Never guess names.** Always query `NVTX_EVENTS` / `StringIds` first.
3. **`theoretical_flops` must come from `compute_theoretical_flops`.** Never estimate.

### Step 4 — Know the entry points

| User wants | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Single profile analysis | `/nsys:analyze` |
| Compare two profiles | `/nsys:diff` |
| MFU / efficiency metric | `/nsys:mfu` |
| Add/improve a skill | `/nsys:refine` |
| Verify your output | `/nsys:validate` |

## Typical First 60 Seconds

When a user loads a profile with no specific question:

```
1. Load skills/triage.md
2. Run get_gpu_peak_tflops()
3. Query top kernels by GPU time
4. Check NVTX and NCCL presence
5. Give a 4-line summary + ask what to investigate
```

When a user asks "what's my MFU?":

```
1. Load skills/mfu.md
2. Run get_gpu_peak_tflops()
3. Discover NVTX/kernel names (never guess)
4. Resolve model architecture (lookup table before asking user)
5. compute_theoretical_flops → compute_region_mfu or compute_mfu
6. Sanity check: MFU must be 0–100%
```

## Common Pitfalls (and How to Avoid)

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Compute FLOPs yourself | Call `compute_theoretical_flops` |
| Use full profile span as step_time | Use single NVTX iteration duration |
| Use `SELECT *` | Name specific columns |
| Guess NVTX name | Query `NVTX_EVENTS` first |
| Divide by 1000 for ms | Divide ns by 1e6 for ms, 1e9 for s |
| Report MFU > 100% | Recompute with narrower `operation` |
| Skip iteration 0 check in diff | Always skip index 0 (JIT warmup) |
