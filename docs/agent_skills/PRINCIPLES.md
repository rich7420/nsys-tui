# nsys-ai Agent Principles

**Source of truth for all nsys-ai agents.** Read this file before acting.
All skill files and slash commands reference this; never duplicate its content.

## Purpose

This harness provides a standard operating procedure (SOP) and toolkit for AI agents
performing GPU performance analysis using `nsys-ai`. The goal: let agents reliably
analyze NVIDIA Nsight Systems profiles (`.sqlite` files), compute efficiency metrics,
and diagnose performance issues without requiring a display or manual inspection.

---

## Key Principles

- **Use the real tools** — Never compute FLOPs, MFU, or time deltas yourself.
  Always call `compute_theoretical_flops`, `compute_mfu`, or `compute_region_mfu`.
  Manual arithmetic on large numbers is unreliable.
- **Discover before acting** — Never guess NVTX region names or kernel names.
  Always query `NVTX_EVENTS` or `StringIds` first.
- **The profile is a hard dependency** — If no profile is loaded, the tools will error.
  Fail clearly: tell the user what profile is needed and why.
- **Fail loudly** — Unambiguous error messages let the agent self-correct.
  Never silently return a wrong answer (e.g. MFU > 100% must be flagged as an error).
- **Provide introspection first** — Triage before computing. Run `skills/triage.md`
  to understand what's in the profile before running MFU or diff analysis.
- **JSON is ground truth** — Tool outputs are JSON. Parse them; do not summarize
  numbers from prose. Pass `theoretical_flops` directly from tool output to the next tool.
- **Time is always in nanoseconds** in the SQLite DB. Divide by 1e6 for ms, 1e9 for s.
- **`theoretical_flops` is never in the profile.** It must be computed from model
  architecture parameters using `compute_theoretical_flops`.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **MFU > 100% is always wrong.** The FLOPs scope is too wide. Stop, recompute with
   narrower `operation`. Do not report a value > 100%.
2. **Never use `SELECT *`.** Always name the specific columns you need.
3. **In diff mode: `search_nvtx_regions` before `get_region_diff`.** Never pass a
   guessed NVTX name to `get_region_diff`.
4. **Never use whole-profile kernel span as single-step time** when multiple iterations
   exist. Use NVTX iteration markers instead.
5. **Skip iteration index 0 in diff analysis.** JIT compilation inflates the first
   iteration. Use index ≥ 1.
6. **Root cause statements are required.** Never say "it got slower." Always state:
   what changed, what the evidence is, and what to do about it.
7. **End your message before waiting for user input.** When you need model architecture
   parameters, ask → end message → wait. Do not proceed without the answer.

## Error Handling

| Error signal | Required action |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `MFU > 100%` | Recompute with narrower operation; explain the error |
| `kernel_count = 0` | Report KERNEL_NOT_FOUND; suggest trying `source="kernel"` |
| `is_aligned=false` in diff | Warn user; switch to `get_global_diff` |
| `Hardware_Warning=true` | Note thermal throttle; advise re-run before concluding |
| `JIT_Compilation_Warning=true` | Skip iteration index 0; re-run with index ≥ 1 |
| `iteration_count = 1` | Profile too short; ask user to re-profile with ≥ 3 iterations |
| GPU unknown in `get_gpu_peak_tflops` | Ask user for peak_tflops (BF16, dense, no sparsity) |
| SQLite error | Check that profile is loaded; verify column names with `PRAGMA table_info` |

---

## Tool Architecture

The agent has **two tool sets** depending on context:

| Set | When active | Tools |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Set A** — Single profile | One profile loaded | `query_profile_db`, `get_gpu_peak_tflops`, `compute_theoretical_flops`, `compute_region_mfu`, `compute_mfu`, navigation tools |
| **Set B** — Diff mode | Two profiles loaded | All of Set A plus: `get_iteration_boundaries`, `search_nvtx_regions`, `get_top_nvtx_diffs`, `get_iteration_diff`, `get_region_diff`, `explore_nvtx_hierarchy`, `summarize_nvtx_subtree`, `get_launch_config_diff`, `get_source_code_context`, `get_gpu_imbalance_stats`, `get_global_diff`, `get_memory_profile_diff` |

---

## Skill File List

Load skill files on demand. Do not pre-load all of them.

| When the user asks… | Load this file |
|--------------------|----------------|
| "What's my MFU?" / "How efficient is my flash attention?" | `skills/mfu.md` |
| "What's in my profile?" / "What's the bottleneck?" | `skills/triage.md` |
| "Why did it slow down?" / "Compare before vs after" | `skills/diff.md` |
| "How is my NCCL?" / "Distributed training is slow" | `skills/distributed.md` |
| "Why do some steps spike?" / "High step-to-step variance" | `skills/variance.md` |
| SQL syntax / query help | `skills/sql.md` |

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Verification Checklist)

After completing any analysis, verify:

- [ ] MFU values are between 0% and 100%
- [ ] `theoretical_flops` was computed by `compute_theoretical_flops`, not estimated
- [ ] NVTX or kernel names came from a query, not guessed
- [ ] Step time came from a single representative iteration (not full profile span)
- [ ] Diff analysis skipped iteration 0
- [ ] Any diff root cause statement includes: cause, evidence field+value, recommendation
- [ ] No `SELECT *` was used
- [ ] Time values were converted from ns (÷ 1e6 for ms, ÷ 1e9 for s)

## Adding a New Skill

To add a new analysis capability:

1. Create `skills/<name>.md` following the **Skill Template** in `skills/SKILL_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Add an entry to the **Skill File List** table above
3. Add a slash command in `commands/<name>.md` if the skill warrants a top-level entry
4. Update `INDEX.md` routing table

**The skill file MUST include:**
- A one-sentence purpose statement at the top
- A complete step-by-step workflow with exact SQL and tool calls
- An Acceptance Criteria section with verifiable checks
